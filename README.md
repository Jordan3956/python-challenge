# python-challenge

This challenge looks at 2 data sets "budget_data" and "election_data"

For the "budget_data" data set, I have done a financial analysis summary that looks at total months, total,

average change, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits.

For the "election_data" data set I am looking at the votes to determine a winner for the election.
